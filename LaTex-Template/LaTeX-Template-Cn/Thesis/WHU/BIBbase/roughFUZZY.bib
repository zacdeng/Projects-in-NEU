  Using the proposed approach, a possibility measure is specified by two modifier functions and a strong negation
   while a necessity measure is specified by two modifier functions only. It is demonstrated that many possibility and
   necessity measures defined by famous conjunction and implication functions are obtained by the proposed approach.
   Conditions for specified measures to have good properties are also given. Finally, a simple example of
   application of possibility and necessity measures to a decision problem is given.",
