# cleaning-robot
- Using opencv and costmap2d to make cleaning plan. 
- Using movebase to contral robot's movement.
- Caution,  I just cost one week to search this work, so it still need much more work if you want to make it runs better.
- The env of this code is Ubuntu14.04, ros_indigo, opencv2. ubuntu16.04-ros-kinetic also test passed.
